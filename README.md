# HDL-Intro
Learning verilog, in theory, as I only have microprocessors and no FPGAs currently.

This comes from Simon Monk's book Programming FPGAs: Getting Started with Verilog. I take no credit for the creation of these modules. They simply serve as a learning tool, similar to a notebook during a lecture.
